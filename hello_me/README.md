1.The library that implements this is SnappingSheetController 
Allowes the user to:
-put the snapping sheet into one ofthe saved posistions
-set the snapping sheet to an exact position (any posistion)
-stop the snapping sheet from snapping if it is currtly doing so
-detect the current position of the snapping sheet
2. The SnappingPositions parameter controls this behaviour
3. Inkwell does an ink splash animation where the user touches
